In this project I got the chance to implement a Dynamic, BGP Based, Highly-Available Site-to-Site VPN between The Hybrid AWS and On-premises environment.

The project consists of 4 stages, each implementing additional components of the architecture

Stage 1 - Provision the environments
Stage 2 - TGW VPN Attachments
Stage 3 - IPSec Tunnel Configuration
Stage 4 - BGP Routing and Testing
